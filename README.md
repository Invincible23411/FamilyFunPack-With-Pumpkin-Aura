This is just Building instructions you can find the fully build FamilyFunPack with Pumpkin Aura jar file on my github (Invincible23411)

# Family-fun-pack-with-Pumpkin-aura
Made by RemainingToast this just has clear instructions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dEgxdLUQoI for clear instructions on how to build everything. 

Commands:
```
.\gradlew setupdecompworkspace
.\gradlew clean
.\gradlew build
```

If things arent working here are fixes:
```
Try doing .\gradlew instead of gradlew
go to the main folder and right click and click open terminal once you have downloaded it and do the next steps
create the JAVA_HOME thingy and also instal jdk8
watch the video all will be understood after watching the video
```
